### To Do list for TowelStick ###

In no particular order:

 * add a default htop conf with my preferred settings (/etc/htoprc?)
 * dig up my wpa_oneoff script and install it
 * remove unneeded kernel modules
 * remove unneeded firmware binaries
 * option to copy rootfs to ramdisk so boot drive can be removed
 * shutdown/reboot commands for the initramfs shell
 * install doc packages to the core image? (only 32M in doc and 38M in man, which will compress very well)
 * install partclone/clonezilla and get them actually working (the original intention of this distro lol)
 * ntfs programs/drivers
 * more backup/restore/imaging utilities
