### To Do list for TowelStick ###

In no particular order:

 * remove unneeded kernel modules
 * remove unneeded firmware binaries
 * option to copy rootfs to ramdisk so boot drive can be removed
 * install partclone/clonezilla and get them actually working (the original intention of this distro lol)
 * ntfs programs/drivers
 * more backup/restore/imaging utilities
